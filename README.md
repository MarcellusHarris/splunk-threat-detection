## Tools & Technologies
- **Splunk Enterprise**
- **Windows Event Logs & Sysmon**
- **MITRE ATT&CK**
- **Sigma Rules**
- **PowerShell Logging**

## Project Goals
- Detect privilege escalation, persistence, and lateral movement
- Use real log data to simulate a compromise
- Build dashboards with queries and visualizations
- Trigger custom alerts based on suspicious activity

---

## Outcome
This hands-on project strengthened my ability to:

- Identify adversary behavior using Splunk  
- Create efficient detection rules  
- Understand event correlation in enterprise environments
